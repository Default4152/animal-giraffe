  <h1>Giraffe Facts</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>They have long necks</li>
    <li>They are multicolored</li>
    <li>Giraffes only spend between 10 minutes and two hours asleep per day.
      They have one of the shortest sleep requirements of any mammal.</li>
      <li>Giraffes live primarily in savanna areas in the sub-Saharan region of Africa. Their extreme height allows them to eat leaves and shoots located much higher than other animals can reach. In particular, they seek out acacia trees. Their long tongues are helpful in eating because they help pull leaves from the trees. Spending most of the day eating, a full-grown giraffe consumes over 45 kg (100 lb.) of leaves and twigs a day.</li>
